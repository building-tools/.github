# Building Tools Organisation

Welcome to the Building Tools organisation! We develop a suite of tools designed to enhance your building experience. Our projects are designed for the latest version (1.20.6) and are continually being improved. Below you will find descriptions of our primary tools and frameworks.

## Projects

### BetterFlowers
**BetterFlowers** is a tool that allows you to use a flower randomiser and enables you to brush with flowers, adding variety and beauty to your landscapes effortlessly.

### BetterBuild
**BetterBuild** offers a comprehensive building system that simulates a builder-specific server by modifying server rules and events. It also includes robust world management features to streamline your building process.

### BetterSkulls
**BetterSkulls** is a plugin providing access to over 50,000 player heads, giving you endless possibilities for customizing your builds and decorations.

### BetterModels
**BetterModels** is a plugin that enables the placement and management of furniture added via a resource pack. This allows for more detailed and realistic interior designs in your Minecraft worlds.
